Mappings
========

The current version of wdmapper is limited to simple 1-to-1 mappings, also
referred to as **Links**. Two kinds of links are supported:

- direct links from Wikidata items to external identifiers that is
  given by a target :doc:`property <properties>`

- indirect links from an external source identifier, given by a source
  :doc:`property <properties>`, to external target identifier, given by a
  target :doc:`property <properties>`, The link is possible through a common
  Wikidata item that uses both source property and target property.


*This introduction needs to be expanded to better explain authority files etc.*
